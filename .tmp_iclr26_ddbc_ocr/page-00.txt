DISCRETE DIFFUSION FOR BUNDLE CONSTRUCTION

ABSTRACT

As a central task in product bundling, bundle construction aims to select a subset
of items from huge item catalogs to complete a partial bundle. Existing methods

time, nevertheless, this paradigm is fundamentally unsuitable for the essentially
unordered bundles. In contrast, the non-sequential construction paradigm models
bundle as a set, while it still faces two dimensionality curses: the combination
complexity is exponential to the catalog size and bundle length. Accordingly, we
identify two technical challenges: 1) howstoreffectivelyrandiefficientlymiodelithe
higher-order intra-bundle relations with the growth of bundle length: and 2) how
to learn item embeddings that are sufficiently discriminative while maintaining a
relatively smaller search space other than the huge item set.

To address these challenges, we propose DDBC, a Discrete Diffusion model for
Bundle Construction. DDBC leverages a masked denoising diffusion process to
build bundles non-sequentially, capturing joint dependencies among items without
relying on certain pre-defined order. To mitigate the curse of large catalog size,
We integrate residual vector quantization (RVQ), which compresses item embed-
dings into discrete codes drawn from a globally shared codebook, enabling more
efficient search while retaining semantic granularity. We evaluate our method on
real-world bundle construction datasets of music playlist continuation and fash-
ion outfit completion, and the experimental results show that DDBC can achieve
more than 100% relative performance improvements compared with state-of-the-
art baseline methods. Ablation and model analyses further confirm the effective-
ness of both the diffusion backbone and RVQ tokenizer, where the performance
gain is more significant for larger catalog size and longer bundle length. Our code

1 INTRODUCTION

Product bundling has been a pervasive business strategy, which originates from conventional retail-
ing, evolves to e-commerce, and is further adopted by generic online services, such as music and
video streaming (Chang et al| 2020). A product bundle is a set of relevant items assembled to satisfy
users’ needs (e.g., games, outfits, playlists, meal kits) (Sun et al.| 2024) and promote sales regard-
ing sellers’ pursuit. Bundle construction, i.e., select a subset of items from the large item pools to
build an entire bundle or complete a partial bundle, is the first and foremost problem among various
bundle-centric studies, such as personalized bundle recommendation (Ma et al.| 2022).

Existing studies, either specifically designed for bundle construction (Han et al. 2017 [Bai et al]
2019; 2019} [Deng et al, 2021) or general sequential recommendation (Kang &
f 2019), have a fatal yet ever-overlooked flaw: most of them are based

the entire bundle, however, such a sequential construction paradigm is essentially not suitable for
bundle construction. Intuitively, a bundle is not a sequence of user’s interacted items, and a user is
not necessarily to follow a certain sequential order to consume the items within a bundle[]} Thereby,
sequential dependencies barely exist between consecutive items in a bundle, and’sequential models
bring marginal’ benefits to bundle construction: Delving deep into the technical foundations, con-

sider N as the total number of items (item catalog size) and k as the bundle length (number of items

‘Some bundles may have a sequential order by design, while here we focus on the general scenarios.
