Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2026

when the bundle length (k:) increases from 30 to 90, the latent-space quality improves substantially
and stable. Specifically, the average OAS decreases consistently from 0.397 (Spotify,_3,) to 0.338
(Spotify,—¢9) and finally to 0.315 (Spotify, 99). Since a lower OAS score indicates lower distance
and higher similarity, this trend suggests that our method has an improved capacity to model longer
bundles.

Table 8: Latent-space quality at A=50. We report the {min, avg, max, var} OAS over test bundles,
corresponding to minimal, average, maximal, and variance, respectively.

Additional ablation study results. We report ablation study results on Spotify, 3) (A=1 or A=10)
in Table[] The results obtained at A=10 are consistent with those observed at A=1. (1) The Residual
Vector Quantization (RVQ) component exhibits to be absolutely indispensable. This result confirms
the substantial mechanism of RVQ to mitigate the dimensionality curse caused by the huge item cat-
alog size (N). (2) The boi token could provide positional guidance and improve latent space quality
largely. Removing the boi token results in a significant performance degradation. (3) Simple data
augmentation (item swapping) proves to be a beneficial technique for enhancing order-agnostic mod-
eling and improving model robustness by mitigating overfitting to specific bundle arrangements. (4)
Although the Token Validity Filter yields only a marginal performance improvement, its inclusion
remains necessary to guarantee the validity of the generated bundles during inference.

the other variants changes exactly one component that is removed from the proposed method.
