Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2026

ETHICS STATEMENT

We affirm compliance with the ICLR Code of Ethics. Our study addresses bundle construction (e.g.,
playlists and fashion outfits) and uses publicly available research datasets and splits released by prior
work; no personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive attributes are collected, inferred, or
released. The inputs consist of item identifiers and non-sensitive metadata, and our models operate
on discretized representations without accessing user profiles. Any code and models we release will
be for research use only and will not include copyrighted media or proprietary assets.

REPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT

We make our method reproducible by specifying the full training and evaluation pipeline, including
the RVQ configuration, diffusion horizon, architecture, schedulers, and all hyperparameters. We pro-

including the implementation of our model as well as the evaluation scripts for F1, Jaccard, and
OAS. Upon publication, we plan to release checkpoints (where licenses permit) to reproduce all
main and ablation results.
