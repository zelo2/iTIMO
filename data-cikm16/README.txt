Flickr User-POI Visits (Melbourne)
==================================================================

Dataset Information: 
This dataset comprises a set of users and their visits to various points-of-interest (POIs) in Melbourne, with a total of 3975 tours and 17,087 visits. The user-POI visits are determined based on geo-tagged YFCC100M Flickr photos that are: (i) mapped to specific POIs location and POI categories; and (ii) grouped into individual travel sequences (consecutive user-POI visits that differ by <8hrs). 

All user-POI visits in each city are stored in "userVisits-Melb-allPOI.csv" that contains the following columns/fields:
 - photoID: identifier of the photo based on Flickr.
 - userID: identifier of the user based on Flickr.
 - dateTaken: the date/time that the photo was taken (unix timestamp format).
 - poiID: identifier of the place-of-interest (Flickr photos are mapped to POIs based on their lat/long).
 - poiTheme: category of the POI (e.g., Park, Museum, Cultural, etc).
 - poiFreq: number of times this POI has been visited.
 - seqID: travel sequence no. (consecutive POI visits by the same user that differ by <8hrs are grouped as one travel sequence).

In addition, the list of POIs can be found in "POI-Melb.csv", along with their POI category (theme), sub-category (subTheme) and lat/long coordinates.
